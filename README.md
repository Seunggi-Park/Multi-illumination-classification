# Multi-Illumination Defect Classification

This repository provides a PyTorch-based implementation of a **multi-illumination surface defect classification model**. It combines an autoencoder-based encoder-decoder structure with cross-reconstruction, multi-view fusion, and smoothed supervision for robust performance under varying lighting conditions.
